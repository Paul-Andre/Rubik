From the comments in the file:

This is the story of how I solved a Rubik's cube for the first time. I wanted to do it without consulting
 any tutorials. I stuggled to do it manually and was thinking to write a program for it quite for a big 
  of time. I finally got to it today.
 
 I wrote a program to help me with it. I did it on a friday night. The whole took something like
 5 hours and I was listening to some mix of nightcore music youtube suggested me all of a sudden.
  It's 3:50 AM now. Before this I was drinking wine with Marek and Neeraj in Mountain View.
